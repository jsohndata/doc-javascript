# Doc: General Notes and Terminologies

## General
* `Mutable` Value that can be changed or modified after it has been created.
* `Code Block` Set of one or more statements that are grouped together and treated as a single unit of execution. Code blocks are denoted by curly braces { }.

* `Concatenation` is a process of combining two or more strings into a single string. This is done using the concatenation operator +, which is used to join two or more strings together.

<br>

## Characters
* `( )` Parentheses
* `{ }` Curly Brackets or Curly Braces
* `[ ]` Square Brackets

<br>

## Variables
* `const` keyword that is used to declare a variable that cannot be mutated or reassigned to a new value.
* `let` keyword that is used to declare a variable that can be mutated or reassigned within the block scope where it was defined. 

<br>

## Equal Signs
* `=` **Assignment Operator**: Assigning a value to a variable.
* `==` **Loose Equality Operator ( or Equality Operator)**: It checks if the values are equal.
* `===` **Strict Equality Operator (or Identity Operator)**: It checks if the values and Datatype are equal.

## JavaScript Datatype
1. `String` string is a sequence of characters that is used to represent text. It can include letters, numbers, symbols, and even spaces.
2. `Number` an integer or a floating-point number 3, 3.234
3. `Boolean`  Any of two values: true or false  true and false

4. `undefined` used to represent a variable or property that has not been assigned a value.
5. `null` used to represent the intentional absence of a value.

6. `Symbol` used to represent a unique identifier for object properties.
7. `Object` key-value pairs of collection of data
8. `BigInt` used to represent integers with arbitrary precision.

## Math Operator (perform arithmetic operations on numeric values)
1. `+` **Addition**: used to add two or more numbers together.
2. `-` **Subtraction**: used to subtract one number from another.
3. `*` **Multiplication**: used to multiply two or more numbers together.
4. `/` **Division**: used to divide one number by another.
5. `%` **Modulus**: used to find the remainder of a division operation.
6. `++` **Increment**: used to increase the value of a variable by 1.
7. `--` **Decrement**: used to decrease the value of a variable by 1.
