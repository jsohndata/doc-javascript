# JavaScript: Functions - Parameters and Arguments

![diagram](https://jsohndata.s3.amazonaws.com/images/github-gist/function-parameters-arguments-diagram.webp)

## Explaination
`Functions` can accept inputs, known as `parameters`, and `return` outputs based on those inputs. When `invoking a function`, you can provide values for the parameters, known as `arguments`.

## Diagram Flow
Here's a simple example of a JavaScript function that accepts two parameters and returns their sum:

<img src="https://jsohndata.s3.amazonaws.com/images/github-gist/legend-letter-b.webp" width="25" /> In this example, num1 and num2 are the `parameters` of the addNumbers function. 


<img src="https://jsohndata.s3.amazonaws.com/images/github-gist/legend-letter-c.webp" width="25" /> The function will `return` the sum of these two numbers, which will be assigned to the result variable.
